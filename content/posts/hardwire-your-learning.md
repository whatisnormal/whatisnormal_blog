What a better way to start this blog as with such an interesting subject as _Learning_, something we take for granted
and accept it as something we can not change.

Let us start by defining what usually we conceive as _Learning_.

I like to describe it as - _the act of structuring, absorbing and consolidating information in your mind_.

You will for sure need to apply your learning capacities when reading this blog-post thus it will feel somewhat like
the movie [Inception](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/) (which explores the concept of dreams into dreams - interesting huh :) )

### A little bit of context
Why did I decided to start with this topic? Well, since I was a teenager I felt some frustrations about not being
able to retain all the desired information in my mind. The challenge was not understanding, but keeping it. Fortunately I
was always somewhat of a bare above average student (but no race-car brain), mostly due to my perseverance on wanting to finish my studies as
fast as possible and start working. On the other hand as time passed, a lot of information was vanishing smoothly. I bet
a lot of people felt this way but well, in my mind I was the only one.

Some years after, I was lucky to embrace a very interesting challenge at an international company which allowed me
to experience and interact with a lot of cultures around the world. The one that matters here was a very peculiar
and challenging project that took place in _Kazakhstan_ - mostly known by the movie [Borat](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443453/).
(On a side note: the movie characterizes the total opposite of what that country resembles. From a badly portrayed rural country,
it really is a place with amazing culture, incredible infrastructures and people with very proficient skills.
For the ones who are not acquainted, it was an ex-USSR country and keeps  still thigh ties to mother Russia, for the bad but also
the good things.)

### But where I am going with all of this?
There I found out that one of the easy to grasps things to identify was the people education.
Most of my co-workers there had a sharp way of thinking and sponge-like way to absorb information. As it got me
intrigued, I asked how most of them highlighted this skill, thus the following was explained to me: 


> The education system focused on not only the specific matter but in how-to learn skills. 

At that time I had a sort of light jealous feeling and it got all over the place. In my mind was like "How the educational system
in my home country did not focused on that? Is no-brainer to teach people on how-to learn, not only to 'spit''
 into into the poor kids.
 
### The Shinning light

Some few years have passed with this remnant feeling of wanting **more** until I stumbled into  [Barbara Oakley](https://barbaraoakley.com/) while listening to a podcast.
It amazed me her story from a person passing similar challenges as I did, well honestly her situation was far worse but she turned the ship around.

Basically she explained her interesting adventure in understanding how does the human being learn and the whole science behind it.
 
Right after that podcast I went google her and found this [Google talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd2dtkMINIw)
where she highlights all the necessary info you need to understand all this "mumbo jumbo".

As I am a book person, checking out her books was the next step for me. During my quest I have discovered the following books: 

- [Learning how to learn](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36647421-learning-how-to-learn)
- [A Mind for Numbers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693655-a-mind-for-numbers)

The sub-titles seem to provide a feel of basic content and targeted for non-adults but it is totally the opposite.
It fits any age and everybody will benefit from it. For sure.

As I am a techy guy and love numbers related stuff, I decided to go with - _A Mind for Numbers_.

### The juicy bits
The book really targets the intended. Goes from the cognitive load topics explaining
why is challenging to retain so much information to the main techniques on how to achieve it.


Let me try to explain its content in simple terms, separating on how do we retain information and some techniques to 
overcome it.

Researchers discovered that our minds in average handle 4 chunks of information. But what is a "chunk" ? Lets define it
for now as a piece of knowledge in your brain that can go from a simple concept to a set previously disengaged chunks that
through the process of learning were consolidated into one chunk.
Thus to learning, our main goal is to optimize at most this limit and compress the chunks by associating information.

For sure you can relate to a "AhAhhh Eureka" moment where you understood a concept, probably relating with previous
retained knowledge. There new chunk formation happened. Amazing right?

### What to do then?
As a continuation of how your mind works, let me introduce you the focused / diffuse mode. Similar to a flashlight, your
mind toggles between these two modes.
The focused mode is like a flashlight concentrated beam targeting a specific problem. Sometimes
this mode can enter a blocking mode, _"Einstellung"_, by thinking in a problem the wrong way. Here enters the _diffuse_ mode
as in a dimmer light with longer radius opposing the concentrating beam from the focused mode. It helps your mind wonder and sends
problem thinking into the background of your mind, but keeping on thinking over the subject without you realizing.
Both modes work in as a pair, one supporting the other thus both need to be used to create chunks more effectively.
As such, figure out new ideas and concepts by focusing initially. Sequentially, turn out focus away from what we want to learn. Enter 
diffuse mode like going for a drive or so.
Learning well means, allow time to pass between focused learning sessions, so the neural patterns have time to solidify properly. It´s like
allowing mortar to dry when you are building a brick wall. On the opposite side, trying to learn everything in a few
cram sessions does not allow time for neural structure to become consolidated in your long-term memory. The result is a jumbled pile of bricks.


   
### Let´s start the party...
First of all, stay calm and keep your stress levels low. When you are too anxious, your body (more in concrete, the [_Amigdala_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala)) 
releases a very special chemical called "Cortisol" which in high levels blocks your capability of thinking in a rightful form.
You ask, "Why do we have this"? This is still a remnant from our ancestors, which had to apply a "Fight or Flight" stance when dealing
with the constant danger. Nowadays humans do nott need to use this mode as often - No Saber-tooth tiger around the corner right?

If you understand how the learning process happens, you wil surely be able to apply a ser of tools at your disposal. Lets enumerate some:


#### See the big picture
First of all, start by seeing and understanding the broader view, even if some pieces are missing. If you are able to define
the boundaries of what you are learning, all the blank parts will be easier to grasp. Eg: When starting a book new chapter,
do a pass-through the headers so you mind absorbs what you will read.

Also, creating a visual boundary can help you have a clear vision.

#### Remove all distractions.

#### Recall
As the name states, recalling something you studied is one of the best and simplest way to absorb information.Simple as:
1. Read a page.
2. Look away.
3. Recall using your own words.

The ideas must be generated from within yourself. Try not to highlight anything you haven´t put in your mind first by recalling.

#### Chunk your problems
![Chunk your problems](/images/hardwire_learning/chunk_ur_problems.png)

* Understand and practice with a problem solution so that if can all come to mind in a flash.
* After solving a problem, rehearse it.

As a song, learn to play it over and over again in your mind.

#### The importance of Sleep
Sleep is when your mind repeats patterns and pieces together solutions. During sleep, cells shrink
causing a striking increase in the space between your cells. It is equivalent to turning on a faucet as it allows
fluid to wash past and push the toxins out.
When you get little sleep the buildup of these toxic products is believed to explain why you cant think clearly.

#### Reviewing & Interleaving
Review the material within a day, so that the initial changes you made in your brain do not fade away. That is how solid neural structures are built.

#### Create stories
The best lectures in math and science are often framed like thrillers, opening with an intriguing problem
that you just have to figure it out.

#### Create and tell analogies
![Analogies](/images/hardwire_learning/create_n_tell_analogies.png)


Imagine you are the subject you are studying. Eg: A simple story of soldiers attacking a fortress from many directions.
The "Mind´s" eye is important because help stage plays and personalize what is being learned. Eg:
Einstein imagined himself has a photon moving at the speed of light, then imagined how a second photon
might perceive him.


#### Space learning repetition
Spread out learning in any subject a little everyday.

#### Eat your frogs first
![Eat our frogs first](/images/hardwire_learning/eat_ur_frogs_first.png)

Tackle the hardest problems before the easiest. As soon as you become blocked, you can switch to one easier problem but it
leverages your mind into dealing into the hardest in the background.

#### The memory palace
![The memory palace](/images/hardwire_learning/the_memory_palace.png){: .align-center}

If you imagine a story or presentation as a set of rooms you can go trough, you will be able to relate several parts of what you want to tell
with a geo-localized way of thinking.


#### How to resist procrastination
We all have the dual feeling about procrastination. We hate not doing a task in favor of a more pleasant one but at the same time 
the pleasant one is sweet for the brain. "Lets do that social network slide-through.. :D"
Sometimes this happens not because the task is dull, but because can be harder, huge thus seem like a steep mountain to climb.

![Time](/images/hardwire_learning/watch.png){: .align-center}

How to help?
 1. Split the task into smaller tasks.
 2. Bound the task execution using time. Use the _pommodoro_ technique by limiting execution to around 25 min. Then rest 10 min or so.
 This also helps switch between the focused/diffuse modes. Any type of timer can support you here but I suggest an analogous timer as
 the a tomato timer. 

![Timer](/images/hardwire_learning/tomato.png)

#### Divide and conquer
![Problems splitting](/images/hardwire_learning/divide_problems_into_smaller.png)

Divide problems into smaller problems, with it you will be able to tackle easily each one with less effort and will
help you right procrastination at the same time.

#### Dealing with fear
Fear can be a blocker to advance with your studies. Do you know that a poster stating something like "What would you do if you were not afraid?" can do wonders.
Look at this daily and aim for something fearless every day. 

#### Redo´s.
Redos come with the territory. If you do not like the way it turned out, do it again. 


### Conclusion
As you can see, there are several ways to enhance your learning process and it is at your hand
to grasp it.
I highly suggest that you try out these methods during your your learning journey. 
If you are like me, a person with a huge thirst to learn more, these will benefit you for sure.
