# Who am I
Video game addicted boy turned new-metal wannabee teenager, turned a Muay-Thai afionado, turned Engineer by heart and soul, turned Software Architect designing distributed systems, turned Engineering Manager boosting highly capable team members, turned Manager of Managers acting as an agent for the organization while always keeping my conduct based on own principles and values (No soul needs to be sold right?).

Ah, and I am the proud father of "If", a high energy mongrel dog, the most free spirit I have ever seen in any sentient being.

# Background
Since I was young, existential topics always came to mind. _Why are we here? Does a higher entity exist? What is the meaning of this?_ It has been an interesting ride. At the same time, during my personal and professional growth I was fortuned to know about several countries and cultures throughout our planet which allowed me to reflect more deeply about the existential domain.

# Motivation
With this humble blog I wish to write about topics of my past, topics of the world and beyond and so on. Through this journey I will be able to improve my communication skills by extending my written articulation. And yes I really need it :) 
First and foremost, I will write for myself, and that is my own interest. While doing that, hope to write in a way that others can understand, even if it is for my future offspring.

I am totally open for suggestions and improvements (thats why I am here right?)

 
# What do I enjoy
* Reading, Reading and improving my knowledge - As Naval Ravikant says "Read what you Love until you Love what you read". And that is one of my mottos. Even if reading requires a lot of focus, thus above mild effort ( depending on the type of book ofcourse ), it is critical habit if someone wants to upgrade oneÂ´s personal or professional life.
* Peace of mind - Even if in our reality having calmness is like a utopic thing to achieve, when my spirit is quiet, oh thats when I am enjoying life.
* "Growing" teams - Since I became tech-lead, then team-lead and now manager  of managers I have developed a profound sense of enjoyment for improving my team members competencies and consequently their personalities. As I usually say, they move from "John Doe" v1 to vN+1.
